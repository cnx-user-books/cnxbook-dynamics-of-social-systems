<title>Models</title>
<para id="id3749920">The concept of a model is very close to that
of an analogy. It is so fundamental to our thought, decision
making, and problem solving processes that it is difficult to
isolate and study; however, to accomplish the goal of simulating
and understanding complicated social systems, it is essential that
we do understand the concept of a model and develop methods for
constructing them. Like many basic concepts, it is best described
by examples:</para>
<section id="id12605387">
<title>Physical Model</title>
<para id="id10457132">To the average person the word "model" might
bring to mind someone modeling a dress, or perhaps a photographer's
model, or even a model airplane or car. Let's consider these cases.
The usual reason for looking at a dress on a model is to imagine
what the dress would look like on one's self without having to buy
it to find out. The photographer uses his camera to make a likeness
of the model in the form of a picture. The model plane or car
allows one to enjoy the details and perspectives of the model
without the problems and expense of actual ownership of the
airplane or car. Indeed, one can try experiments on the models that
would be very difficult or expensive to actually perform on the
real thing.</para>
<para id="id10457155">Consider the methods and purposes behind the
architect's model of a building, the car designer's prototype of a
new design, or the aerodynamicist's wind tunnel model of a new
airplane. As one considers what is common to these ideas of a model
and what purposes are served, perhaps the concept begins to take
shape.</para>
</section>
<section id="id12408762">
<title>Mental Model</title>
<para id="id12304020">Rather than further pursue the various types
of physical models, let us consider another less obvious form of
model, the mental model. For example, the merchant who mentally
speculates: "if I increase the price of this article from x to y,
the buyers will still buy enough that I will come out ahead," and
the mother who says, "if I spank my child for leaving his toys out,
he will stop", are both using intuitive mental models of incredibly
complicated economic, sociological, and psychological systems that
even experts don't agree on. Freud, Skinner, Erikson and others
have all produced models of human psychology that much of modern
therapy and advertising are based on. Indeed, reflection indicates
that much of human thought is involved with mental model making and
the use of these models for decision making, problem solving, or
merely pleasure.</para>
<para id="id17243990">The politician who tells the voters what will
happen if certain policies are followed, the advertiser who tells
the potential buyer the results of using his product, and the
preacher who predicts the consequences of evil to his followers are
all involved with the building and use of mental and verbal
models.</para>
<para id="id40510073">Even the simple speculation of "if I wear
these clothes I will look nice" is based on a model of how one's
friends will respond to one's dress. Indeed, most processes of
experience can be viewed as model building, experimentation, model
modification, etc. Further reflection shows how much of one's
mental activities can be viewed as involved with modeling and how
many academic disciplines are based on models, even though the
concept and process is poorly understood and seldom explicitly
discussed.</para>
<para id="id39445584">It may seem that the idea of a model and its
use is being made so general that it is useless. Our purpose in
being so general is to search for what is common in these diverse
examples, and to extract it for study and more efficient
use.</para>
</section>
<section id="id40546494">
<title>Mathematical Model</title>
<para id="id39127265">Rather than follow further examples of mental
or verbal models, we will turn to another form of model: the
mathematical model. The incredible advances of the physical
sciences and engineering disciplines have resulted from the
development and use of mathematical models. When one describes the
relation between the force applied to an object and its mass and
acceleration by the familiar formula 
<m:math display="inline">
  <m:mrow>
    <m:mi>F</m:mi>
    <m:mo>=</m:mo>
    <m:mi>M</m:mi>
    <m:mo>â‹…</m:mo>
    <m:mi>A</m:mi>
  </m:mrow>
</m:math>
 , one is using a
mathematical model of a physical phenomena. Here, mathematical
functions are used to represent physical qualities, so that the
interrelationship can be described by equations. If these equations
are fundamental and if their solutions accurately simulate the
actual phenomena, then they are given the special status of "laws".
Consider the cases of Newton's laws, Kirchoff's laws, Faraday's
law, Boyle's law, and in other fields, Fechner's law
(psychophysics), Paneto's law (economics), etc. Indeed, model
formulation and verification is the basis of the so-called
scientific method.</para>
<para id="id40197121">An important feature of the various types of
models we have discussed is how one can move from one to another.
Consider the following hypothetical account of how a physical "law"
was developed.</para>
<para id="id40425270">At some point in time it was noticed that if
a heavy object was dropped, it fell down. As further experience was
accumulated, it was noticed that the object always fell in a
straight line toward the earth. Next, after closer observation, it
was discovered that the object's speed increased as it fell. The
next step was a major one. It required curiosity, mathematical
ability, and a real quantum jump to move from the verbal model to a
mathematical one where it was conjectured that the velocity was a
linear function of time after being dropped, V = Kt . This proved
to be incredibly accurate, and thus, a "law" was discovered.</para>
<para id="id39886636">The use of mathematical models has been so
successful in many areas that the concept of a model was sometimes
forgotten. Indeed, some models are so accurate that users can
forget that they are dealing with models and not the actual
phenomenon. When we work in areas where accurate models are not
available, a good understanding of the modeling process becomes
essential.</para>
<para id="id11276346">The first step in choosing a model is
deciding what the purpose of the model will be and what questions
are being asked. It is obviously an advantage to use the simplest
model possible to serve a particular purpose but the danger that
over-simplification will destroy the validity of the model always
exists.</para>
<para id="id40297069">The second step is the actual construction of
the model. Here, the various theories, laws, relations, etc. that
apply must be used, and after that, the model requires that new
relations be established. In other words, while building the model,
one often discovers what data should be collected and what
experiments must be performed, as well as what data is irrelevant
or misleading. At this point, alterations are often substantial in
the model.</para>
<para id="id40175671">The third step is verification or validation
of the model. This usually involves some comparisons of the model
with the phenomenon it models. One must be very careful at this
point to test all of the characteristics the model should have,
while remaining within the original goals and purposes set, not
violating the assumptions that were made. A common mistake is to use models outside the
area for which they were intended.</para>

<para id="id40466991">Verification often involves applying the
model to data that was not used in its construction to see if it
can explain the observations. If internal relations were used to
derive some data, these can be compared with observations. On the
other hand, if the model were built by forcing agreement with the
observations, then the resulting implied internal relations can be
examined for their validity.</para>
<para id="id27975474">All of these steps are done in a rather
circular fashion with the attempted use of, and verification of,
the model suggesting modification, restructuring and
reverification, or in some cases, discarding the whole approach.
Some reflection will perhaps show that these are common ideas in
modeling, and we try to systematically apply them to the very
interesting but very difficult problem of modeling large groups of
people.</para>
